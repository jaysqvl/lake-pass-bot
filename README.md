# Lake Pass Bot

Lake Pass Bot is a self-hosted app for planning and booking lake passes. Set up a supported lake once, choose a date and passes, then follow the booking in Jobs. A Go service provides the web UI, scheduling, job state, and encrypted storage; separate supervised Python/Playwright processes perform the browser actions.

> [!WARNING]
> The default private HTTP mode sends traffic, including temporary OTPs, without encryption. Before exposing the app through an HTTPS tunnel, complete setup privately and configure [public HTTPS mode](docs/public-exposure.md). The app uses its own accounts; Cloudflare Access is optional. See [Security](SECURITY.md) for account boundaries and remaining runtime trust.

## Features

- Scheduled and on-demand bookings with manual approval or automatic confirmation; advanced CLI commands also support dry runs.
- Configurable pass priority and an immediate, manually approved checkout for passes already released.
- Administrator and member accounts with isolated Yodel sign-ins, OTP sources, personal defaults, requests, and job history. Change your own username or password from Account.
- Lake connection status on Home, provider sign-in within each lake, an independent OTP sources page, and general defaults in Settings.
- Read-only inbound OTP retrieval through either BlueBubbles or Twilio, with no provider fallback or outbound messaging.
- Durable jobs, restart recovery, and an `outcome_unknown` state that prevents unsafe retries after an ambiguous confirmation.

Only one booking attempt may reserve a Yodel sign-in and visit date, across
manual and scheduled runs. Success and unknown outcomes keep that reservation
even when job history is pruned. A cancellation or failure before confirmation
allows another attempt. Inspect the Yodel wallet after an unknown outcome;
creating another request or changing confirmation mode will not bypass the guard.

## Supported lakes

| Lake | Provider | Support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buntzen Lake | Yodel | Parking passes, authentication, dry runs, and bookings |

The destination catalog supplies each lake's supported passes, URLs, and release
defaults. **Lakes** lets each account choose its vehicle keyword and customize
the lake's booking rules. Each lake owns its provider connection and booking preferences.
Provider browser behavior is kept in its adapter.
See [lake settings and provider extension](docs/lakes.md).
Only the lake listed above is currently supported.

## Quick start with Docker Compose

Build this checkout locally with the steps below. For registry-based installs,
choose an image from a completed [release publication](docs/release-and-deployment.md#release-publication).
Existing installs should read the [rebrand migration notes](docs/rebrand-migration.md)
first.

1. Create the local configuration:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and:

   - if using BlueBubbles, set `BLUEBUBBLES_URL` and approve its origin/network with `LAKE_PASS_BLUEBUBBLES_ENDPOINTS` as described in [provider access](docs/public-exposure.md#outbound-provider-access); and
   - leave `SCHEDULES_ENABLED=false` until onboarding is complete.

   Hostname checks are off by default for private LAN hosting: you can use your Docker host address or rename a reverse proxy hostname without changing an allowlist. Administrators can enable checks and edit allowed host/port values in **Settings > Network**. Saving applies immediately and survives restarts. Authentication, CSRF tokens, and browser-origin checks remain enabled.

   Leave `LAKE_PASS_HOST_CHECK_ENABLED` empty to manage this in the UI. An explicit `true` or `false` is an operator override that locks the UI controls; use `false` to recover from a hostname lockout. See [private HTTP hostnames](docs/public-exposure.md#private-http-hostnames) for upgrades and recovery.

   If a reverse proxy rewrites the `Host` header, add the browser-facing origin to `LAKE_PASS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; with hostname checks enabled, also allow the rewritten authority. Prefer preserving the browser-facing Host. Public HTTPS mode always requires its configured public Host and trusted connector settings, regardless of the toggle; see [public HTTPS configuration](docs/public-exposure.md).

2. Create the persistent data directory for the container's non-root user:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p appdata
   sudo chown -R 1001:1001 appdata
   ```

3. Build and start the service:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

4. If you did not set `LAKE_PASS_SETUP_TOKEN`, read the generated one-time token from the startup log:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs lake-pass-bot
   ```

5. Open `http://<docker-host>:8080`, enter the setup token, and create the permanent administrator account. Passwords must be at least 12 characters.

Treat `appdata` as sensitive: it contains the database and browser profiles. The default encryption key is beside the database, so copying the whole directory also copies its decryption key. For a separate read-only key mount and matching backup/recovery procedure, see [key storage](docs/public-exposure.md#key-storage-and-recovery). Only one Lake Pass Bot instance may use an appdata directory.

## Portainer installs and updates

[deploy/portainer.yml](deploy/portainer.yml) targets
`ghcr.io/jaysqvl/lake-pass-bot:latest`. Verify that the selected release's image
publication completed before updating an existing stack. GitHub builds and
verifies release images; you choose when to deploy them in Portainer.

Existing saved stacks can keep their variable names when updating the image.
When adopting the current template, set its three required canonical variables:
`LAKE_PASS_WEB_PORT`, `LAKE_PASS_APPDATA_PATH`, and `LAKE_PASS_SECCOMP_PROFILE_PATH`. Preserve the existing values; see the
[template migration table](docs/rebrand-migration.md#adopting-the-portainer-template).

The app footer shows the build actually running. See
[Release and Portainer deployment](docs/release-and-deployment.md) for stack
settings and version pinning, and [rebrand migration](docs/rebrand-migration.md)
for existing data and configuration compatibility. The source-build Compose
instructions above also support isolated local review.

## Set up and test a booking

Keep `SCHEDULES_ENABLED=false` while completing these steps:

1. Open **Lakes**, choose **Buntzen Lake**, and follow its connection setup. Open **OTP sources** and configure BlueBubbles or Twilio. For BlueBubbles, enter its operator-approved server URL and password, then use **Test connection**. The first source becomes your default; use **Make default** to select another source.
2. Return to **Lakes → Buntzen Lake**, choose **Add Yodel account**, enter a name and the 10-digit Canadian or US mobile number used by Yodel, and save it enabled. Set your preferred browser defaults in **Settings** before adding a sign-in if needed.
3. Choose **Sign in to Yodel** in that lake’s Connection section. With BlueBubbles, select the fresh OTP candidate after Yodel sends a code. This signs in without creating a booking request or reserving a pass.
4. On the lake page, save its vehicle keyword and booking preferences. The sole enabled account is used automatically. If you added multiple accounts for this lake, choose **Use for bookings** on the one to use. Preparation, retry timing, and final confirmation preferences belong in **Settings**; keep **Manual approval** selected while testing.
5. Open **Bookings** and choose **Book** for the lake. Pick the visit date and up to three pass priorities: All-day, Afternoon, Morning, or None. Select at least one pass without duplicates, then press **Book**. The app takes you directly to the new job.
6. If passes have not released, the job waits for the lake's preparation and release schedule. If they have released, it starts as soon as a worker is available and always requires manual approval. Review the intended date, pass, and vehicle before approving, then verify the issued pass in Yodel. See [Testing a live booking](docs/live-testing.md) for timing, expiry, cancellation, and retry behavior.
7. Test a future release separately before relying on release timing or automatic confirmation. Verify the OTP provider still works after its host restarts. **Book** explicitly queues a job even with `SCHEDULES_ENABLED=false`; that switch only controls automatic creation of jobs from older saved requests. Use **Cancel job** in Jobs to stop queued work.

**Home** shows lake connection status, upcoming visits, and recent jobs. Accounts without a configured lake connection are directed to **Lakes** to begin setup. **OTP sources** is an independent page for
configuring inbox connections and choosing the account's default source.
**Settings** holds personal preparation, retry timing, and final confirmation
preferences shared across lakes, plus browser defaults and account management.
**Lakes** holds each lake's booking account, vehicle keyword, release schedule,
pass preferences, and booking URLs. Sign-in URLs are managed internally.
The **Book** form asks only for the visit date and pass choices; update setup on
the lake page or in Settings instead of overriding it for an individual visit.

New Yodel sign-ins copy the account's browser defaults. Each booking job captures
the selected lake's settings, the visit choices, and the account's timing and
confirmation preferences. Changing defaults does not change existing sign-ins,
saved requests, or queued jobs. Resetting lake preferences preserves the chosen
booking account. Newly queued jobs
capture the selected default OTP source; changing that default does not reroute
already queued jobs. Multiple Yodel sign-ins can use one owned source, with
browser and inbox locks preventing concurrent use of the same resources.

Requests created before this flow remain under **Bookings → Saved requests**.
Open one to view it or choose **Delete saved request**. Deletion stops future
automatic queueing from that request and preserves completed job history and
reservation records. Cancel any pending job or wait for it to finish before
deleting. New visits are tracked in Jobs without creating another reusable
request to manage.

Before a booking, the Yodel cart must be empty. The bot checks that adding the
selected pass produces exactly one item of quantity one, then rechecks it before
confirmation. Cancelling a manual test can leave that item in Yodel's cart;
inspect and clear it in Yodel before starting the next booking test.

BlueBubbles can retrieve an OTP only when the SMS reaches Messages on its Mac through Messages in iCloud or text-message forwarding. Keep that Mac awake and connected to the network.

## Native macOS development

Native development requires Go 1.27, Python 3.12, `uv`, and a local BlueBubbles server:

```bash
brew install go uv
uv sync --project actions --locked --python 3.12

export APPDATA_DIR="$PWD/.native-appdata"
export LAKE_PASS_PYTHON="$PWD/actions/.venv/bin/python"
export BLUEBUBBLES_URL="http://127.0.0.1:1234"
export LAKE_PASS_BLUEBUBBLES_ENDPOINTS='[{"origin":"http://127.0.0.1:1234","networks":["127.0.0.1/32"]}]'
export SCHEDULES_ENABLED=false

go run ./cmd/lake-pass-bot serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Select `chrome` in **Settings** for new native Yodel sign-ins, or bundled Chromium in Docker. Existing sign-ins keep their saved browser choice. If Chrome is installed elsewhere, the operator can set `LAKE_PASS_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` to its absolute executable path; this overrides channel choices for every worker. User-supplied executable paths are rejected.

Do not share browser profiles between Docker and macOS or run the same Yodel identity from both at once.

## Common commands

Advanced CLI commands remain available for an existing booking request ID,
including a sign-in check and a dry run that stops before adding a pass to the
cart. These actions are separate from the web **Book** flow. Replace `1` below
with the intended request ID and run against the same appdata used by the service.
In Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose exec lake-pass-bot lake-pass-bot doctor
docker compose exec lake-pass-bot lake-pass-bot auth-check --booking 1
docker compose exec lake-pass-bot lake-pass-bot dry-run --booking 1
docker compose exec lake-pass-bot lake-pass-bot book --booking 1 --mode auto
```

Reset the permanent administrator's password without storing it in `.env`:

```bash
docker compose exec \
  -e LAKE_PASS_ADMIN_PASSWORD='new-long-password' \
  lake-pass-bot lake-pass-bot admin-password reset
```

For live logs, use `docker compose logs --follow --tail=300 lake-pass-bot`. Set `LAKE_PASS_DEBUG=true` in `.env` and recreate the container only while diagnosing a problem; return it to `false` afterward.

## Tests

```bash
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
uvx --from ruff==0.12.10 ruff check actions scripts/release
uv run --project actions --locked python -m unittest discover -s actions/tests
```

See [Browser integration tests](integration/README.md) for the real Go/Python/Playwright test command.
