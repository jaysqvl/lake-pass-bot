# Browser integration tests

The browser tests are guarded by the `integration` build tag because they start
the real Python worker and real headless Chromium processes. Together they cross:

1. the Go coordinator and bounded JSON-lines subprocess protocol;
2. the pinned `lake_pass_actions` Python package and persistent Playwright context;
3. an ephemeral HTTPS fake Yodel login and OTP form; and
4. the real query-only BlueBubbles adapter backed by a bounded fake API.

All credentials and OTPs are synthetic. The OTP test verifies that BlueBubbles is
armed before the browser triggers MFA, that Chromium submits the resulting OTP,
that transient hub state is cleared, and that logs, durable event messages, and
diagnostics do not retain the synthetic secrets. Raw browser capture is disabled;
the suite requires an empty artifact directory after authenticated activity.
The booking test starts from a synthetic authenticated session and covers date,
pass, and vehicle selection plus dry-run, manual approve, manual cancel, and
automatic final confirmation. It uses Yodel's padded calendar labels and actual
checkout response/dialog structure, including sold-out responses, missing issued
passes, and delayed response bodies. It verifies the manual decision barrier
and that an already-authenticated booking never touches BlueBubbles.

The fake provider's OTP and booking pages live in `testdata/yodel/` as readable
HTML templates. The Go handlers select cart quantities, visible vehicle labels,
and synthetic credentials through `yodelFixtureData`; scenario changes do not
depend on replacing a particular occurrence of text inside the page.

The separate offline Chromium calendar cases cover independent morning and
afternoon calendars, missing dates, month mismatches, ambiguous metadata, delayed
selection, and cancellation. These fixtures check known website contracts; they
do not authenticate or make reservations on the live Yodel service.

The vehicle cases run the production selection helper in Chromium against a
sanitized copy of Yodel's September 2026 vehicle widget DOM. The fixture retains
the separate pass cards, hidden saved-vehicle popups, an unrelated hidden make
picker, accessible radio choices, and the explicit Save button. Names, plate
values, and dynamic IDs are synthetic. The cases reproduce the previous heading
click and hidden-label failure conditions and require a unique visible choice,
checked radio state, Save, and the selected vehicle appearing back on the correct
pass card. They also cover ambiguous or missing matches, disabled or ineffective
Save, incorrect saved selection, cancellation, and bounded interaction timeouts.

These vehicle fixtures model the website's event handlers locally. Passing them
proves the helper handles the captured structure and modeled transitions; it
does not prove that a live account can complete checkout, that inventory remains
available, or that future provider markup will be unchanged. Live authentication,
saved-profile inspection, and a completed reservation are separate evidence and
must be reported separately.

Run it from the repository root after syncing the locked Python environment and
installing the pinned Playwright browser:

```sh
uv sync --project actions --locked
uv run --project actions playwright install chromium
go test -race -tags=integration ./integration -count=1 -timeout=5m
```

The tests use `actions/.venv/bin/python` when available and otherwise invoke
`uv`. Set `LAKE_PASS_E2E_PYTHON` or `LAKE_PASS_E2E_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` to explicit
absolute executables when a runner uses a non-standard layout.
